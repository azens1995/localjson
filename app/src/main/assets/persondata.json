      "poem": "\nTonight at dusk we linger by the fence\naround the garden, watching the wound husks\nof moonflowers unclench themselves slowly,\nalmost too slow for us to see their movingâ€”\nyou notice only when you look away\nand back, until the bloom decides,\nor seems to decide, the tease is over,\nand throws its petals backward like a sail\nin wind, a suddenness about this as though\nit screams, almost the way a newborn screams\nat pain and want and cold, and I still hear\nthat cry in the shout across the garden\nto say another flower is about to break.\nI go to where my daughter stands, flowers\nstrung along the vine like Christmas lights,\none not yet lit. We praise the world by making\nothers see what we see. So now she points and feels\nwhat must be pride when the bloom unlocks itself\nfrom itself. And then she turns to look at me.\n\n",
